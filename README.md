Machine Learning Engineer. I build fast, scalable AI systems—LLM inference, diffusion models, and distributed infrastructure.

**Stuff I've built**  
- Diffusion model that generates maze solutions frame-by-frame.
- Chrome extension that actually makes long ChatGPT chats usable.  
- LLM inference engines serving 1k+ req/min.  
- Distributed speech-to-text pipelines (20k+ recordings/day).  
- Real-time clustering for millions of data points.
- More.
