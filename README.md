Machine Learning Engineer. I build fast, scalable AI systems—LLM inference, diffusion models, and distributed infrastructure.

- Built LLM inference engines serving 1k+ req/min.  
- Engineered distributed speech-to-text pipelines (20k+ recordings/day).  
- Designed real-time clustering for millions of data points.

**Stuff I've built**  
- **Maze Solver (Diffusion Model):** Diffusion model that generates maze solutions frame-by-frame.  
- **ChatTree:** Actually making long ChatGPT chats usable.  
- More.
